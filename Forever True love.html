     The True Love is - One old man - 80 year old, he went to hospital to get his stiches removed. He asked the doctor - "please hurry up ", It was 8:30 He said , by 9 0 clock , I need to go to another hospital ". The doctor said ,"you have another appointment ?"
     He said , "No , I need to go and meet my wife . We have breakfast together." So, He explained how his wife had Alzheimer's, 
     and it have been five years. He neverthless fulfilled his commitment. He would definitely go and have breakfast with her.
     So, the doctor asked,"Will your wife not be upset that you're getting late today?" He said "you know since last few years,she doesn't recognise me". 
     So, the doctor said "In that case what sense does it make?" She doesn't even know who you are, and still you go and have 
     breakfast with her? He said " whether she recognise me or not, I recognise who she is. I made a commitment to this lady 
     50 years ago, and I have to fulfill that commitment".</p>

     <p> # If somebody is willing to make the sacrifices, willing to make the adjustments then that person can truely find
         love.
     </p>
     <p># The True Love is that, where there is no self seeking. The urge is to give, to sacrifice. Not my happiness, But the 
         happiness of the beloved. </p>
